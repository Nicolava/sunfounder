2.2.4 IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor
===================================

Introduction
-----------------

In this project, we will learn IR obstacle avoidance module, which is a sensor module that can be used to detect obstacles at short distances, with small interference, easy to assemble, easy to use, etc. It can be widely used in robot obstacle avoidance, obstacle avoidance trolley, assembly line counting, etc.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/2.2.5_ir_obstacle_circuit.png
   :width: 700
   :align: center

**Step 2:** Change directory.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::
   
   cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

   sudo python3 2.2.5_IrObstacle_zero.py

After the code runs, when you put your hand in front of the module's probe, the output indicator on the module lights up and the "Detected Barrier!" will be 
repeatedly printed on the screen until the your hand is removed.

**Code**

.. note::

   You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import Button
   import time

   # Initialize the obstacle sensor connected to GPIO pin 17
   # The sensor is configured with a pull-up resistor
   obstacle_sensor = Button(17, pull_up=True)  

   try:
      # Continuously monitor for obstacles
      while True:
         if obstacle_sensor.is_pressed:  # Check if the sensor is triggered
               print("Detected Barrier!")  # Print a message when an obstacle is detected
               time.sleep(1)  # Delay for 1 second to avoid repetitive messages

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
      # Handle KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) for a clean and safe exit
      pass


**Code Explanation**

#. This line sets the script to run using Python 3. It imports the ``Button`` class from gpiozero (used for the obstacle sensor) and the ``time`` module for delays.

   .. code-block:: python

      #!/usr/bin/env python3
      from gpiozero import Button
      import time

#. Initializes an obstacle sensor connected to GPIO pin 17 with an internal pull-up resistor.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Initialize the obstacle sensor connected to GPIO pin 17
      # The sensor is configured with a pull-up resistor
      obstacle_sensor = Button(17, pull_up=True)  

#. In a continuous loop, the program checks if the obstacle sensor is activated (``is_pressed``). If an obstacle is detected, it prints "Detected Barrier!" and then waits for one second (to prevent repetitive messages). The ``try-except`` structure is used to handle a KeyboardInterrupt for a clean exit.

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
         # Continuously monitor for obstacles
         while True:
            if obstacle_sensor.is_pressed:  # Check if the sensor is triggered
                  print("Detected Barrier!")  # Print a message when an obstacle is detected
                  time.sleep(1)  # Delay for 1 second to avoid repetitive messages

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         # Handle KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) for a clean and safe exit
         pass
