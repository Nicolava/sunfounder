Play with Python (not for Pi 5)
=================================

.. warning::

    ``RPi.GPIO`` is a widely-used GPIO library, but unfortunately, it hasn't been updated to support the latest Raspberry Pi 5. As a result, any Python programs written using this library won't be compatible with the Pi 5. It's essential to adapt to newer libraries like ``GPIO.Zero`` for seamless compatibility with the latest hardware.
