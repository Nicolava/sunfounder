Smart Fan
===========

In this project, you can see the temperature from Blynk and turn on the fan remotely.

.. note:: Before starting this project, we recommend that you complete :ref:`bk_start_py`. The following will give you a clear understanding of Blynk.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

2. Add a Switch widget and a Label widget to the Dashboard.

    .. image:: img/sp220914_175437.png

3. Create a Datastream (I used V3) for the Switch widget. It will be used to turn on the Motor.

**3. Run the Code**

1. Edit the code

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/blynk-raspberrypi-python
    sudo nano blynk_motor.py

2. Find the line below and past your ``BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN``.

.. code-block:: python

    BLYNK_AUTH = 'YourAuthToken'

3. Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo python3 blynk_motor.py

4. Go to Blynk, on the Dashboard you can check the temperature via Label widget; you can turn on/off the fan via Switch widget.

#. If you want to use Blynk on mobile devices, please refer to :ref:`blynk_mobile`.
