Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`windows_remote_desktop`.

**Step 2:** Check if the camera is enabled. For instructions, please refer to: :ref:`enable_camera`.

**Step 3:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.


.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 4:** Run.


.. code-block::

    sudo python3 3.1.2_VideoModule.py

Run the code to start recording. Press ``Ctrl+C`` to end the recording. Name the video ``my_video.h264`` and store it in the ``~`` directory.

.. note::

    You can also open ``3.1.2_PhotographModule.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.

If you want to send photos to your PC, please refer to :ref:`filezilla`.


**Code**

.. code-block:: python

    from picamera import PiCamera
    import os
    user = os.getlogin()
    user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')


    camera = PiCamera()
    
    def setup():
        camera.start_preview(alpha=200)
    
    def main():
        camera.start_recording(f'{user_home}/my_video.h264')
        while True:
            pass    
    
    def destroy():
        camera.stop_recording()
        camera.stop_preview()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        setup()
        try:
            main()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            destroy()

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    start_recording(output, format=None, resize=None, splitter_port=1, **options)

Start recording video from the camera, storing it in ``output``.

.. code-block:: python

    camera.stop_recording()

End the recording.
