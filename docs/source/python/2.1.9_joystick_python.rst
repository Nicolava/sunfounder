2.1.9 Joystick
==============

Introduction
------------

In this project, We're going to learn how joystick works. We manipulate
the Joystick and display the results on the screen.

* :ref:`Resistor`
* :ref:`Joystick Module`
* :ref:`ADC0834`

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

When the data of joystick is read, there are some differents between
axis: data of X and Y axis is analog, which need to use ADC0834 to
convert the analog value to digital value. Data of Z axis is digital, so
you can directly use the GPIO to read, or you can also use ADC to read.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/image193.png

**Step 2:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.9_Joystick.py

After the code runs, turn the Joystick, then the corresponding values of
x, y, Btn are displayed on screen.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    import ADC0834
    import time

    BtnPin = 22

    def setup():
        # Set the GPIO modes to BCM Numbering
        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
        GPIO.setup(BtnPin, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
        ADC0834.setup()

    def destroy():
        # Release resource
        GPIO.cleanup()

    def loop():
        while True:
            x_val = ADC0834.getResult(0)
            y_val = ADC0834.getResult(1)
            Btn_val = GPIO.input(BtnPin)
            print ('X: %d  Y: %d  Btn: %d' % (x_val, y_val, Btn_val))
            time.sleep(0.2)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        setup()
        try:
            loop()
        except KeyboardInterrupt: # When 'Ctrl+C' is pressed, the program destroy() will be executed.
            destroy()

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    def loop():
        while True:
            x_val = ADC0834.getResult(0)
            y_val = ADC0834.getResult(1)
            Btn_val = GPIO.input(BtnPin)
            print ('X: %d  Y: %d  Btn: %d' % (x_val, y_val, Btn_val))
            time.sleep(0.2)

VRX and VRY of Joystick are connected to CH0, CH1 of ADC0834
respectively. So the function getResult() is called to read the values
of CH0 and CH1. Then the read values should be stored in the variables
x_val and y_val. In addition, read the value of SW of joystick and store
it into the variable Btn_val. Finally, the values of x_val, y_val and
Btn_val shall be printed with print() function.
