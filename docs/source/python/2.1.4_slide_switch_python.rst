2.1.4 Slide Switch
==================

Introduction
------------

In this project, we will learn how to use a slide switch. Usually,the
slide switch is soldered on PCB as a power switch, but here we need to
insert it into the breadboard, thus it may not be tightened. And we use
it on the breadboard to show its function.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

Connect the middle pin of the Slide Switch to GPIO17, and two LEDs to
pin GPIO22 and GPIO27 respectively. Then when you pull the slide, you
can see the two LEDs light up alternately.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/image161.png

**Step 2**: Get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python

**Step 3**: Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.4_Slider.py

While the code is running, get the switch connected to the left, then
the yellow LED lights up; to the right, the red light turns on.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    import time

    # Set GPIO17 as slide switch pin, GPIO22 as led1 pin, GPIO27 as led2 pin
    slidePin = 17
    led1Pin = 22
    led2Pin = 27

    # Define a setup function for some setup
    def setup():
        # Set the GPIO modes to BCM Numbering
        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
        # Set slidePin input
        # Set ledPin output,
        # and initial level to High(3.3v)
        GPIO.setup(slidePin, GPIO.IN)
        GPIO.setup(led1Pin, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
        GPIO.setup(led2Pin, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)

    # Define a main function for main process
    def main():
        while True:
            # slide switch high, led1 on
            if GPIO.input(slidePin) == 1:
                print ('    LED1 ON    ')
                GPIO.output(led1Pin, GPIO.LOW)
                GPIO.output(led2Pin, GPIO.HIGH)

            # slide switch low, led2 on
            if GPIO.input(slidePin) == 0:
                print ('    LED2 ON    ')
                GPIO.output(led2Pin, GPIO.LOW)
                GPIO.output(led1Pin, GPIO.HIGH)

            time.sleep(0.5)
    # Define a destroy function for clean up everything after
    # the script finished
    def destroy():
        # Turn off LED
        GPIO.output(led1Pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        GPIO.output(led2Pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        # Release resource
        GPIO.cleanup()                    

    # If run this script directly, do:
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        setup()
        try:
            main()
        # When 'Ctrl+C' is pressed, the program
        # destroy() will be  executed.
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            destroy()   

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    if GPIO.input(slidePin) == 1:
                GPIO.output(led1Pin, GPIO.LOW)
                GPIO.output(led2Pin, GPIO.HIGH)

When the slide is pulled to the right, the middle pin and right one are
connected; the Raspberry Pi reads a high level at the middle pin, so the
LED1 is on and LED2 off.

.. code-block:: python

    if GPIO.input(slidePin) == 0:
                GPIO.output(led2Pin, GPIO.LOW)
                GPIO.output(led1Pin, GPIO.HIGH)

When the slide is pulled to the left, the middle pin and left one are
connected; the Raspberry Pi reads a low, so the LED2 is on and LED1 off.
