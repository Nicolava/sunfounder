4.1.4 Automatic Capture Camera
===================================

Introduction
-----------------

When you are out, the little squirrels in the woods might visit your windowsill. Let's make a automatic capture camera to leave pictures of these little cuties!

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

Before this project, you need to make sure you complete :ref:`3.1.1 Photograph Module` .

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

**Step 2:** To connect the camera module and complete the configuration, please refer to: :ref:`Camera Module`.

**Step 3:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`Remote Desktop`.

**Step 4:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 5:** Run.

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 4.1.4_AutomaticCaptureCamera.py

After the code runs, PIR will detect the surrounding environment, and if it senses the little squirrel passing by, the camera will take a photo.
The photo interval is 3 seconds, and the total number of photos taken will be displayed through the print window.

There are two potentiometers on the PIR module: one is to adjust sensitivity and the other is to adjust the detection distance. To make the PIR module work better, you You need to turn both of them counterclockwise to the end.

.. note::

   You can also open ``4.1.4_AutomaticCaptureCamera.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.



**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   from picamera import PiCamera
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time
   import os
   user = os.getlogin()
   user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')


   camera = PiCamera()

   pirPin = 17    # the pir connect to pin17

   def setup():
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(pirPin, GPIO.IN)
      camera.start_preview(alpha=200)

   def main():
      i = 1
      while True:
         pirVal = GPIO.input(pirPin)
         if pirVal==GPIO.HIGH:
               camera.capture(f'{user_home}/capture%s.jpg' % i)
               print('The number is %s' % i)
               time.sleep(3)
               i = i + 1

   def destroy():
      GPIO.cleanup()
      camera.stop_preview()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      setup()
      try:
         main()
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         destroy()

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

   pirVal = GPIO.input(pirPin)
   if pirVal==GPIO.HIGH:
         camera.capture(f'{user_home}/capture%s.jpg' % i)
         print('The number is %s' % i)
         time.sleep(3)
         i = i + 1

Every time a little squirrel is detected by the PIR module, the Raspberry Pi will take a photo and tell you through the print window how many pictures have been taken. The interval between each photo is 3s.
