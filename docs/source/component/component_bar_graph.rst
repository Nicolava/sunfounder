LED Bar Graph is an LED array, which is used to connect with electronic
circuit or microcontroller. Itâ€™s easy to connect LED bar graph with the
circuit like as connecting 10 individual LEDs with 10 output pins.
Generally we can use the LED bar graph as a Battery level Indicator,
Audio equipments, and Industrial Control panels. There are many other
applications of LED bar graphs.

The following is the internal schematic diagram of LED Bar Graph. Generally speaking, the side with the label is the anode and the other side is the cathode.
