Play with Scratch (for Pi 4) 
============================

Scratch is a block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8-16 as an educational tool for coding. Users of the site can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.


Here you will learn to use Scratch 3 in Raspberry Pi and access Raspberry Pi GPIO with Scratch 3, which is not possible with online Scratch.

.. note::

    When programming with Scratch 3, you may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Of course, if you don't have a screen, you can also access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`windows_remote_desktop`.
