Load the Code and See What Happens
---------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.9_drumming.sb3``) to Scratch 3.

When you tap on the touch switch module, you will hear the sound of drums coming from the speaker.


Tips on Sprite
----------------

Delete the default sprite, then find the **Drum-snare** sprite and add it, and change the size to 200.

Scratch has a **Music** extension to play instruments and drums, now add it via the **Add Extension** button.

Tips on Codes
--------------

When pin17 is low (not tapped on the touch switch module), switch the **Drum-snare** sprite costume to **drum-snare-a**.

When you tap on the touch switch module, gpio17 is low. At this point, the **Drum-snare** sprite costume is switched to **drum-snare-b** and the drum sound played on speaker.
