Load the Code and See What Happens
-----------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.8_service_bell.sb3``) to Scratch 3.

Press the micro switch and the service bell will ring once.

.. note::
  
  If your Raspberry Pi is connected to a screen with speakers, it may cause no sound from this external speaker, please refer to :ref:`Change Audio Output` for the solution.

  Also, if you want to adjust the volume level, please refer to :ref:`Adjust Volume`.

Tips on Sprite
----------------

Select Sprite1 and click **Costumes** in the top left corner; upload **bell1.png** and **bell2.png** from the ``~/raphael-kit/scratch/picture`` path via the **Upload Costume** button; delete the default 2 costumes, and rename the sprite to **bell**.

When pin17 is high (the Micro switch is not pressed), switch the costume of the **bell** sprite to **bell1** (released state).

Press the micro switch, gpio17 is low level. At this time, switch the costume of the **bell** sprite to **bell2** (press state), and play a sound effect through the speaker.
