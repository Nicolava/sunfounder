Inflating the Dot
===========================

Next, let's build a circuit that allows the button to control the size of the dot.
When we press the button, the dot will quickly get bigger; when we release the button, the dot will gradually get smaller, which makes the dot look like a balloon being inflated.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components.

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Sketch**

.. code-block:: arduino

    import processing.io.*;
    int buttonPin = 18; 

    float diameter;

    void setup() {
        size(200, 200);
        frameRate(64); //set frame rate
        GPIO.pinMode(buttonPin, GPIO.INPUT_PULLUP); 
        diameter = width*0.5;
    }

    void draw() {
        if (GPIO.digitalRead(buttonPin)==GPIO.LOW) {
            if(diameter<width*0.8) {diameter=diameter+5;}
        } else {
            if(diameter>=width*0.2) {diameter--;}
        } 
        background(192, 16, 18);
        ellipse(width/2, height/2,diameter, diameter);
    }

**How it works?**

This project uses the input function compared to the previous 2 projects that used the output function of the GPIO.

The ``GPIO.pinMode()`` function is used to set ``buttonPin`` to pull-up input mode, which makes the pin get high automatically in the default state.

Then use the ``GPIO.digitalRead()`` function to read the value of ``buttonPin``. When the value is LOW, it means the button is pressed, at which point let the diameter of the dot increase by 5; if the button is released, then the diameter of the dot will decrease by 1.
