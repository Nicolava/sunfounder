Build the Circuit
---------------------

.. image:: img/1.3_fritzing.png


Load the Code and See What Happens
-----------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.3_tumbler.sb3``) to Scratch 3.

When the tilt switch is placed upright, the tumbler is standing. If you tilt it, the tumbler will also fall. Place it upright again, and the tumbler will stand up again.


Tips on Sprite
----------------
Select Sprite1 and click **Costumes** in the top left corner; upload **tumbler1.png** and **tumbler2.png** from the ``~/raphael-kit/scratch/picture`` path via the **Upload Costume** button; delete the default 2 costumes, and rename the sprite to **tumbler**.

Tips on Codes

When the green flag is clicked, the initial state of gpio17 is set to low.

When pin17 is low (the tilt switch is placed upright), we switch the tumbler sprite's costume to tumbler1 (upright state).

When pin17 is high (tilt switch is tilted), switch the tumbler sprite's costume to tumbler2 (tilt state).
